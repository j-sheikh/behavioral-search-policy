# Semantic Search-based online policy

Reinforcement learning and Imitation Learning approaches utilize policy learning strategies that are difficult to generalize well with just a few examples of a task. In this work, we propose a language-conditioned semantic search-based method to produce an online search-based policy from the available demonstration dataset of state-action trajectories. Here we directly acquire actions from the most similar manipulation trajectories found in the dataset. Our approach surpasses the performance of the baselines on the CALVIN benchmark and exhibits strong zero-shot adaptation capabilities. This holds great potential for expanding the use of our online search-based policy approach to tasks typically addressed by Imitation Learning or Reinforcement Learning-based policies.
